<h2>Data Structures</h2>
<p>
	Code, code, code ...<br>
	Give plenty of time to understand Data Structures also C++<br>
	<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/">Geeks for Geeks Tutorial</a>
</p>

<hr>


<h2>Database Systems</h2>
<p>
	Exams and lesson part was easier while compared to Analysis of Algorithms but you should do exercise, for both success in the course and to be a better data engineer.<br>
	Project might be very stressful for just YZV groups you may consider to group with CS students for especially frontend. Search for <a href="https://relational.fit.cvut.cz">relational databases</a>.
</p>

<hr>


<h2>Analysis of Algorithms I</h2>
<p>
	Showing your work was not sufficient neither in the midterm nor in the homeworks, you must be excellent to get points.<br>
	You should read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844">the text book</a> to understand concepts more clearly.<br>
	<b>RB Tree</b><br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvZGUFHWChY&list=PL9xmBV_5YoZNqDI8qfOZgzbqahCUmUEin">Basics</a><br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6eDztNiJwo">A good example</a><br>
	<b>Hashing</b><br>
	It was very complex at the beggining but after you understand the intuition and search method for hash tables everthing makes sense.<br>
</p>

<hr>


<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
	Details needed for your project will not generally be thought in the lesson so, when a project is assigned make a research about how the things are going in there then, plan your project. Do not keep it until the deadline. Be responsive to your teammates.
